DESCRIPTION OF TASK : THIS PROJECT DEMONSTRATES THE USE OF A DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER TO CLASSIFY IRIS FLOWERS BASED ON THEIR PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS. IT USES THE POPULAR IRIS DATASET, WHICH IS A BENCHMARK DATASET IN MACHINE LEARNING. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO TRAIN A MODEL THAT CAN ACCURATELY PREDICT THE SPECIES OF AN IRIS FLOWER USING FEATURES SUCH AS SEPAL LENGTH, SEPAL WIDTH, PETAL LENGTH, AND PETAL WIDTH. IN ADDITION, THIS PROJECT VISUALIZES THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE TRAINED DECISION TREE, OFFERING A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE CLASSIFICATION MODEL MAKES DECISIONS.

THE IRIS DATASET CONTAINS 150 OBSERVATIONS, WITH EACH FLOWER CLASSIFIED INTO ONE OF THREE SPECIES: IRIS SETOSA, IRIS VERSICOLOR, AND IRIS VIRGINICA. THE DATASET INCLUDES FOUR NUMERIC FEATURES FOR EACH SAMPLE. THIS DATASET IS WELL-SUITED FOR BEGINNERS BECAUSE IT IS CLEAN, SMALL, AND HAS CLEARLY SEPARABLE CLASSES, MAKING IT IDEAL FOR EXPLORING CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS.

THE PROJECT BEGINS BY IMPORTING NECESSARY LIBRARIES SUCH AS PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB.PYPLOT, AND MODULES FROM SCIKIT-LEARN. THE DATASET IS LOADED USING THE LOAD_IRIS() FUNCTION FROM SKLEARN.DATASETS. A PANDAS DATAFRAME IS CREATED TO PREVIEW THE FEATURE DATA AND UNDERSTAND THE DATASET STRUCTURE. THE FEATURES (X) AND THE TARGET LABELS (Y) ARE THEN EXTRACTED FOR MODEL TRAINING.

A DECISIONTREECLASSIFIER FROM SKLEARN.TREE IS USED TO BUILD THE CLASSIFICATION MODEL. THE DECISION TREE ALGORITHM WORKS BY RECURSIVELY SPLITTING THE DATA INTO SUBSETS BASED ON THE FEATURE VALUES THAT RESULT IN THE HIGHEST INFORMATION GAIN OR LOWEST IMPURITY (LIKE GINI INDEX OR ENTROPY). IN THIS CASE, THE DEFAULT CRITERION IS USED (GINI IMPURITY). THE MODEL IS TRAINED USING THE .FIT(X, Y) METHOD.

AFTER TRAINING, THE MODEL IS VISUALIZED USING PLOT_TREE() WHICH SHOWS THE STRUCTURE OF THE TREE WITH NODES, CONDITIONS, FEATURE NAMES, AND CLASS PREDICTIONS. THE VISUALIZATION CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES HOW THE MODEL USES DIFFERENT FEATURES AT EACH NODE TO DIVIDE THE DATA AND REACH A PREDICTION AT THE LEAF NODES. THE TREE IS ALSO SAVED AS A .PNG IMAGE TO USE IN REPORTS OR PRESENTATIONS.

THIS PROJECT PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT HANDS-ON EXAMPLE OF HOW DECISION TREES OPERATE, HOW THEY STRUCTURE THEIR LOGIC, AND HOW MODEL DECISIONS CAN BE INTERPRETED VISUALLY. DECISION TREES ARE POWERFUL FOR SMALL TO MEDIUM DATASETS AND ARE ESPECIALLY APPRECIATED FOR THEIR INTERPRETABILITY.

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:
•	PYTHON
•	PANDAS (FOR DATA HANDLING)
•	SCIKIT-LEARN (FOR LOADING DATA, MODEL TRAINING, AND VISUALIZATION)
•	MATPLOTLIB (FOR PLOTTING THE DECISION TREE)

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
•	UNDERSTANDING HOW TO LOAD AND PREPROCESS A DATASET USING PANDAS AND SCIKIT-LEARN.
•	TRAINING A DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER TO SOLVE A MULTI-CLASS CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM.
•	VISUALIZING AND INTERPRETING A TRAINED DECISION TREE USING PLOT_TREE().
•	LEARNING HOW DECISION TREES USE FEATURE-BASED SPLITTING TO MAKE DECISIONS.
